# Student Pass/Fail Determination Based on Marks

## Description

This C program determines if a student has passed or failed based on the following criteria:

- The student must have a minimum of **33%** in each individual subject.
- The student must have an overall **40%** or higher.

The program takes the marks for three subjects as input, calculates the overall percentage, and checks if the conditions for passing are met. If any subject mark is out of the range of 0â€“100, the program displays an error message.
